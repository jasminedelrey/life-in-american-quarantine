# Life In American Quarantine üè†
Jasmine Reyes' Senior Comprehensive Project for Occidental College's Computer Science department.

Run this project as follows:

1. Clone the repository onto your local machine. This experience works best on a 16-inch screen.
2. While in the repository, enter the Terminal command, "node server.js".
3. Open the website in localhost:3000

For room.js lines 177-195, you will find comments referring to a popupvideo #. Due to the size of the videos used for this area, the project from this repository will not include them. Download the videos here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mEjduPrtYvwN2UxPu3vhgfMidWs8ZNXL?usp=sharing. You can add the video files to the repository's "images" folder and reference the file in the lines that the comments indicate.
